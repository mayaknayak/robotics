launch file: example_force_control/prismatic_1dof_robot_w_jnt_ctl.launch
  references config in: .../control_config/one_dof_vel_ctl_params.yaml
  which sets pure velocity-control proportional gain
  
run with:
  roslaunch gazebo_ros empty_world.launch 
  roslaunch example_force_control prismatic_1dof_robot_w_jnt_ctl.launch 
  rosrun example_force_control sine_commander 
    (enter amp and freq)
  view with: rqt_plot
  test tuning w/ rosrun rqt_reconfigure rqt_reconfigure
  
Next: ******want to create a force sensor;
   (use a plug-in for controller? ) 
   or simply tolerate time delay, etc, of force controller
   
   then, cmd velocity as:
     K_virt, M_virt, B_virt
     
     M_virt*acc_ideal = K_virt*(x_attractor - x_state) - B_virt*v_state + F_sense
     
     --> acc_ideal = (1/M_virt)*{K_virt*(...) - B_virt*... + F_sense}
     --> v_ideal += acc_ideal*dt;
         v_ideal = sat(v_ideal,v_sat)
         
     command v_ideal to velocity controller
